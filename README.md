# HTML extensions for FunScript

Extensions for [FunScript] (http://funscript.info/) for working with HTML. For the moment, it just includes methods to generate event streams from HTML elements which can be used with the Observable module or in asynchronous workflows. There are also extensions to use the same techniques with the [Ractive.js framework] (http://www.ractivejs.org/).

Check the samples to see what can be done with the library. Please post an issue if you find a bug or have any request.

Have fun!
